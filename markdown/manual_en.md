### 1.0.1 Moving Image Work   
   
   A moving image Work comprises both the intellectual or artistic content and the process of realisation in a cinematographic medium, e.g., what it is called, when it was made, who made it, who was in it, what it is about, etc.   
   
   A Work as a conceptual entity is the topmost level of description. It may be published or unpublished, complete (whole) or incomplete (unfinished or missing content), edited or unedited. It is intended to function as the “node” that relates all Variants and Manifestations of a Work to a common creation. A Work contains the characteristics that are inherited across any Variant, Manifestation, or Item derived from that Work. It also reflects the original intentions of its realisation, including: circumstances of the creation process such as date(s) and place(s) of production, most contributions by agents such as directors, screenwriters, production companies and cast members, as well as certain statements about the contents.25   
   
   The concept of moving image Work includes moving image realisations of events or performances – such as edited or unedited recordings of a play or concert performed in a theatre, a sporting event, a street performer, a medical procedure, etc.   
   
   In addition, moving images created by use of automatic devices such as surveillance cameras or vehicle-mounted cameras, can also be considered moving image works if they are subject to collecting or publishing activities.   
   
   The presence of artistic intent in the creation of a moving image entity is not a prerequisite for considering it a moving image Work. A moving image entity can be considered as a Work on a very broad spectrum of creative intent, from the classic fiction feature film at one extreme (with artistic input from dozens or hundreds of creative contributors), through amateur film (with a modicum of creative intent by one individual), to CCTV footage or other automatic recording outputs at the other extreme.   
   
   Works may have one-to-many relationships with instances of Variant and Manifestation/Item and many-to-many relationships with instances of Agent(s,) Event(s), Content(s), Subject(s) and Other Relation(s).26
